# Placement_Cell_Website

We wanted to build a real-life application – something that adds value to the lives of HITK students.
Currently, our college has a site for the placement cell which talks about it, records the last few
years’ placement statistics and provides contact information of the various officials. This is the
public facing site for HITK. Our idea was to expand upon this and build an internal site for the
placement cell which actively involves students and caters to their needs during the internship and
placement seasons.

We have built a site where The Placement Office (TPO) can post about active on and off campus job
and internship opportunities. The students can register on the site, login, and access these posts. They
can read about the job role, description, last date to apply, visit the career page of the company using
the link provided and apply for the role using the link provided. There is a comments section below
each post where students can clarify their doubts about that specific opportunity. There is a separate
dedicated “Ask a Query” portal where students can ask generic doubts pertaining to placements and
have other staff members or students answer their queries. We have also included a “About the
Placement Cell” section, “Hall Of Fame” section to recognize students places with exceptional
packages.
